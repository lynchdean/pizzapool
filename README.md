## A carpool-style pizza ordering web app.

This app was designed so that people could organise and pre-order a full pizza together rather than all queuing in the restaurant individually. (And saving some money too)

**The first launch in collaberation with [Mild Activity Run Club](https://www.instagram.com/mildactivity) for their Wednesday Social at [Bambino](https://www.instagram.com/bambino_dublin) was a total success:**
 - Removed the need to organise buying full pizzas in a large community WhatsApp group.
 - Allowed the all orders to all be placed in one call, removing the need for each person to contact the restaurant individually.
 - Provided Revolut details for each of the orders, and a WhatsApp contact for those who need a reminder to pay their share.
 - 10 full orders made. 80 slices deleivered, 58 of those distributed to different people with the help of the app.
 - A noticibly shorter queue in the restaurant, meaning those who weren't fortunate enough to use the app to claim a slice also benefitted by having to wait less time to make an order.

**Pizzapool has been used ever since for each of the Mild Activity Wednesday Social events! Some stats will be shared once the Wednesday Socials finsh up for the year.**
