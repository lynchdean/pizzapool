            <p>
                pizzapool is a carpool-style pizza ordering web app.

                This app was designed so that people could organise and pre-order a full pizza together rather than all
                queuing in the restaurant individually (And saving some money too).
                <br><br>
                <strong>The first launch in collaberation with Mild Activity Run Club for their Wednesday Social at Bambino was
                    a total success:</strong>

                <ul>
                    <li>Removed the need to organise buying full pizzas in a large community WhatsApp group.</li>
                    <li>Allowed the all orders to all be placed in one call, removing the need for each person to contact the
                        restaurant individually.</li>
                    <li>Provided Revolut details for each of the orders, and a WhatsApp contact for those who need a reminder to
                        pay their share.</li>
                    <li>10 full orders made. 80 slices deleivered, 58 of those distributed to different people with the help of
                        the app.</li>
                    <li>A noticibly shorter queue in the restaurant, meaning those who weren't fortunate enough to use the app
                        to claim a slice also benefitted by having to wait less time to make an order.</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>pizzapool has been used ever since for each of the Mild Activity Wednesday Social events, and more features are still on the way.</strong>
